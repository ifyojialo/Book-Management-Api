# Book-Management-Api

## Project Description
Welcome to my Book Management API project, developed using Node.js. This API provides a backend solution for managing a library of books, featuring essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This project showcases my ability to build and manage RESTful APIs, integrate with MongoDB, and apply best practices in Node.js development.

## Project Overview

The Book Management API allows users to:

- **Create** new book records.
- **Read** book records (both single and all books).
- **Update** existing book records.
- **Delete** book records.

The API is designed to demonstrate core skills in backend development, including RESTful service creation, data handling with MongoDB, and basic server management.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Follow standard HTTP methods for interaction.
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports full lifecycle management of book records.
- **Data Persistence**: Uses MongoDB for storing book data.
